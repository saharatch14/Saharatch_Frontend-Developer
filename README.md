PART A
1.Code Reading
a. "1, 0" because The watch on count monitors changes to its value and logs the new value (newVal) and old value (oldVal). In the mounted lifecycle hook, this.count++ executes, changing count from 0 to 1.
b. double will be re-computed when count changes, specifically after the mounted hook runs and increments count from 0 to 1.

2.Debugging
a. Yes
b. Ensure this.title is always a string before calling toUpperCase().
